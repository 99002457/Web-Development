    Activities for Schools: Black and Asian Involvement

    The resources on this page can be used by teachers and community educators in classrooms and learning centres. Lesson Plans are based on extracts from stories which were submitted to the WW2 People's War site. They are suitable for both primary and secondary students and have curriculum links to History, English, RE, Citizenship and Media Studies.
    
        Lessons meet the skill and content requirements for the UK curriculum in history, English and citizenship (England and Wales).
        It may be possible to use some exercises to support RE classes at Key Stages 2, 3 and 4.
        The lessons could be adapted to use as part of centre-designed history coursework for Key Stage 4.
        Some topics will naturally fit into one lesson and others may run over a number of weeks.
    
    This lesson plan includes:
    
        Lesson 1: Black and Asian Contributions (Key Stages 3 and 4)
        Lesson 2: Discrimination (Key Stages 2, 3 and 4)
        Lesson 3: Childhood heroes (Key Stages 2 and 3)
    
    How to use these lesson plans
    
        Use as a structured scheme of work on the British Home Front, 1939-45.
        Use as generic lesson plans for the teacher, rather than material to be given direct to the pupils.
        Alter the plans and cut and paste questions in order to make resource sheets according to the ability and age of the pupils.
        The plans are for mixed ability groups, although the teacher may want to split groups and tasks according to ability.
    
    The list of resources at the beginning of each lesson includes a reference to stories and images from the BBC's WW2 People's War site, extracts from which are in the Story extracts page. You may find it useful to print out the full stories. There is also a guideline of preparation materials that are generally found in schools or can be provided by the teacher.

    Historical outline
    
    The Commonwealth began with the independence of India in 1947. It included countries that had previously been part of the British Empire. Many of these countries had sent troops to fight in Europe during World War Two. There are now 54 member countries spread through Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, the Mediterranean, North America and the Pacific. Its 1.7 billion people are over a quarter of the world's population. Over half are young people aged 25 or under. Equality, justice and democracy are the core beliefs of the Commonwealth.The second Monday in March every year is Commonwealth Day.
    Teaching and Learning Activities
    
    Starter Activity
    
        Write the word 'common' on the board.
        Ask a few individual pupils in the class to say what they think it means.
        Then ask pupils in silence to write a sentence definition of the word 'common'.
        Once they have completed the sentence ask pupils to exchange definitions with a partner. They should then discuss their ideas and create a definition that includes both their ideas.
        Ask each pair to join with another pair to form a group of four.They should then exchange definitions, discuss their ideas and create a final definition.
        Ask each group to feed back to the rest of the class and reach a class definition.
        Repeat these steps for the word 'wealth'.
        Then ask each group to put the two words together and reach a definition.
        Ask each group to feed back their ideas to the class.
        Discuss as a class the themes of working together and sharing heritage.
        Introduce the historical background of the Commonwealth and ask what common heritage the countries shared. Link to the ideas of the British Empire (see outline above).
        Ask the class if they can name some countries that have joined the Commonwealth that may have taken part in World War Two.
    
    Activity 1
    
    Split the class into groups of four pupils and give each group a copy of both extracts. Ask the pupils to read the extracts and identify quotations that explain why the people in the stories joined up. Use these quotations to compile a list of the reasons why the West Indian and Indian soldiers joined up.
    
    Ask each group to feed back their ideas to the class.
    
    Activity 2
    
    The class could do this whole activity in an ICT room and access the story Making a Difference - Experiences of a Black British Serviceman online. Otherwise, hand out a copy of the extract to each group.
    
    Set up the IWB (if you are using it). Present the pupils with a table like the one below to record research from the story. Model the first answer. For example:
